                <p>
                    1 - Everybody sees me today in the position I’m in, a fast growing company. 
                    They don’t really understand the story and the struggle behind my success; 
                    where I’ve come from, and really what it takes to achieve success.
                </p>

                <p>
                    1 - Todos me veem hoje na posição em que estou, 
                    em uma empresa em crescimento acelerado. 
                    Eles realmente não entendem a história e a luta por 
                    trás do meu sucesso, de onde eu vim, e o que realmente 
                    é preciso para atingir o sucesso.

                <h1>PARAGRAFO 2</h1>
                <p>
                    2 - My story starts like many others around this world; 
                    it starts unfortunately growing up in poor situation. 
                    I grew up in a pretty wealthy area being poor, 
                    and I think there’s nothing worse in life than growing up poor 
                    in the face of people having everything.            
                </p>
                <p>
                    A minha história começa como muitas outras pelo mundo; 
                    ela começa infelizmente crescendo em situação de pobreza. 
                    Eu cresci em uma área muito rica sendo pobre, 
                    e eu acho que não existe nada pior na vida do que crescer
                     pobre na presença de pessoas que tem tudo.
                </p>

                <h1>PARAGRAFO 3</h1>
                <p>
                    3 - It makes you really realize what you don’t have. 
                    When you grow up in an area where nobody has anything, 
                    you’re kind of all on a level playing field. 
                    But when you grow up in a wealthy area where everybody seems 
                    to have so much more than you, you know, you know that you don’t 
                    have as much as them. You know your parents don’t have as much money. 
                    I realize what I don’t have, I realize what I wanted, and I made sure 
                    from a very young age that I would succeed at every goal I’ve ever dreamt of.
                </p>

                <h1>PARAGRAFO 4</h1>
                <p>
                    4 - Seeing my parents work and struggle inspired me to work. 
                    I didn’t have the money like everybody else did when they went to University 
                    where their parents paid for them, and they had the nice cars, 
                    I worked three jobs to put myself through University. I graduated, 
                    and till this day I’m so thankful that I had to go through those 
                    experiences because it’s those struggles, and those hardships that define me as a person.
